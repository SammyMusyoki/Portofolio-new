Open Graph Images are meta tags that define the visual representation of a webpage when shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and others.
This image serves as the preview thumbnails, giving users a glimpse of the content before they decide to click on the link. With a proper Open Graph Image, you can tell users more info about your page's content and in a visually appealing way. This not only helps the user who sees your link know more about your page, but also helps decide how relevant and useful your page would be.

### Why do you need Open Graph Images?

Here are a few reasons why having an Open Graph Image is Important:

1. **Visual impression:** When a link is shared on social media, the Open Graph image is displayed alongside the text description. An engaging and relevant image can capture attention, increase click-through rates, and encourage users to interact with the content.

2. **Control over preview:** Without an Open Graph image, social media platforms may choose a random image from your webpage  as the preview, which may not accurately represent the content. By specifying an Open Graph image, you have control over which image is used and can ensure it reflects the essence of your content.

3. **Branding and recognition:** The Open Graph image can include visual elements related to your brand, such as a logo or specific colors. By consistently using a branded image across all shared content, you can reinforce your brand identity and make your content easily recognizable.

4. **Shareability and virality:** An attention-grabbing Open Graph image is more likely to be shared by users, increasing the potential for your content to go viral. Visual content is often more shareable, and a well-designed image can make your link stand out amidst the flood of other content on social media.
